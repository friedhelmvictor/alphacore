# AlphaCore

AlphaCore is a novel core decomposition algorithm that leverages data depth (specifically, Mahalanobis depth) to identify and rank the most central nodes in complex networks. Unlike traditional methods (e.g., k-core) that only consider the number of connections, AlphaCore integrates multiple node features without normalization, offering a more robust analysis of network structure.

"_Alphacore adopts a depth-based methodology to address multidimensional node attributes, leveraging the Mahalanobis depth for the identification of core structures based on depth. This approach allows for the nuanced analysis of nodes with multiple attributes, distinguishing Alphacore from traditional core detection methods._" [Kim et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2024.120664)

## Usage

Until this is packaged, source the file algorithms/alphaCore.R

### Get a graph with named vertices and edge weights:

```
g <- erdos.renyi.game(200, 2/200, directed = T)
E(g)$weight <- 1:ecount(g)
V(g)$name <- paste("v", 1:vcount(g), sep="")
```

### Run alphaCore with default parameters

```
> alphaCore(g)
   node          alpha batch
   1:     v1 0.0000000    18
   2:     v2 0.0000000    10
   3:     v3 0.0000000    12
   4:     v4 0.0000000     6
   5:     v5 0.4193455    24
 ---
196:   v196 0.4193455     25
197:   v197 0.0000000     12
198:   v198 0.4193455     24
199:   v199 0.0000000     11
200:   v200 0.4193455     23
```

### Run alphaCore with builtin edge property functions

```
> alphaCore(g, features = c("indegree", "triangles"))
   node      alpha    batch
   1:     v1     0       4
   2:     v2     0       7
   3:     v3     0       5
   4:     v4     0       4
   5:     v5     0       5
   6:     v6     0       4
   ---
195:   v195 0.3842658    12
196:   v196 0.0000000     7
197:   v197 0.0000000     5
198:   v198 0.0000000     4
199:   v199 0.3842658    12
200:   v200 0.0000000     4
```

### Python implementation (contributed by Jason Zhu!) example:

```
> import networkx as nx
> G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n=200, seed=1, p=2/200, directed=True)
> for idx, (u,v,w) in enumerate(G.edges(data=True)):
      w['value'] = idx

> alphaCore(G)
   nodeID 	alpha   batchID
0 	    18 	  0.0         0
1 	    75 	  0.0 	     0
2 	    78 	  0.0 	     0
3 	    25 	  0.3 	     5
4 	    91 	  0.3 	     5
... 	... 	  ... 	   ...
195 	  8 	  0.7 	    27
196 	131 	  0.7 	    27
197 	185 	  0.7 	    27
198 	192 	  0.7 	    27
199 	158 	  0.7 	    28
```

## Evaluation

In order to run, you first need to download the three datasets:

### Token Networks (11.4GB)

The files are hosted at: https://zenodo.org/record/4898412
Store the transfers.db in data/tokens/transfers.db
The matching exchangeLabels.csv file should be placed at data/tokens/exchangeLabels.csv

### Reddit Crosslinks

The reddit crosslinks are part of http://snap.stanford.edu/conflict/conflict_data.zip
In the zip file, they can be found in /prediction/detailed_data/
Place the file at the location data/reddit/post_crosslinks_info.tsv

### Flight routes

Get this file from http://opsahl.co.uk/tnet/datasets/openflights.txt
and store it in data/flights/openflights.txt.

### Running the evaluation

Open up the file evaluation.R from the main directory.

This is the main file to run the evaluation.
Input your number of CPU cores and the path to the extracted database file.

To run the entire evaluation, ideally do so on a server with Rscript, as some algorithms, i.e. some centralities depending on all pairs shortest path computations, and our own implementation of weighted k-core have very long running times. The full executing takes between 1-3 days, depending on hardware.

AlphaCore with an exponentially decaying step size however is quite fast, even though it is only an R implementation.
